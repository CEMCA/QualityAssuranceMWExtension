<h1> OER Quality Assurance Mediawiki Extension </h1>

Mediawiki extension for judging the quality of OERs based on a subset of the TIPS framework 2.0. The extension allows one to enable a comprehensive review for the quality of an OER (present on a wiki page) by adding a simple tag to the page.

Simply add the tag:

<code>&lt;qa&gt;&lt;/qa&gt;</code>
	
to the wiki page where the content of the OER is present.
